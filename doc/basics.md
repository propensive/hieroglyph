### Character Display Width

Lithography provides an extension method, `displayWidth`, on `Char` which will
return the amount of space the glyph for that character will take up, when
rendered in a mono-spaced font.

Unsurprisingly, this will usually be `1`, but many characters in alphabets that
are not based on the Latin Alphabet will need two normal character widths of
space when rendered.

However, calculating the width of a character (and, in particular a string of
characters) will be much slower if every character must be checked individually,
and totalled, when the `length` field of a string can provide the same value in
constant (and fast) time, for strings which are known not to contain any "wide"
characters.

Therefore, methods which need to perform text width calculations can use either
a `uniform` mode or an `eastAsianScripts` mode, depending on the contextual
value imported from the `textWidthCalculation` package.

For example, compare,
```scala
import textWidthCalculation.uniform
'x'.displayWidth   // returns 1
'好'.displayWidth  // returns 1
```
and,
```scala
import textWidthCalculation.eastAsianScripts
'x'.displayWidth   // returns 1
'好'.displayWidth  // returns 2
```

[Gossamer](https://github.com/propensive/gossamer/) provides a corresponding
`displayWidth` extension method on all text-like types, which calculates the
display width of the entire string by summing its character widths, or, with
`textWidthCalculation.uniform` in scope, simply returns the `length` value.
